Type of challenge: **learning**
Duration: **1/2 day**
Team challenge: **solo**

## Learning objectives

- Use Git for solo work, by using the terminal.
- Deploy via "GitHub Pages" technology.
- Make sure there is a README file on the github page.


## Instructions

- Work alone.
- Read this [article first](https://dev.to/flexdinesh/create-your-developer-landing-page-with-github-pages---42jk), it presents the result to be achieved.
- Then follow these [instructions](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page#github-pages).
- Customize the content of your page.
- Force yourself to use Git as much as possible only by using the terminal.
- Once your page is online (normally a URL that looks like https://{username}.github.io, post that URL on our Discord channel).


## The final

- As you become more adept at html, css and javascript, you will be able to improve this page and customize it further.
- Who knows: **if** you do this with love and care, it will be useful for networking and getting an internship.
