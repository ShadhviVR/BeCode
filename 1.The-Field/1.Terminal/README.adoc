== Help

If you have **Linux** (Ubuntu): good for you! Everything will work just fine.

If you have a **Mac**: most commands will work fine, but for some you will need to search for a Mac-specific alternative. Google is your friend ðŸ˜‰

If you have **Windows 10**: the easiest thing is to install the Ubuntu shell from the Windows Store, and most commands will work fine. Some might need Windows-specific alternatives. Google is your friend ðŸ˜‰

If you have **Windows 7**: you should either update to Windows 10, or install the full Ubuntu Desktop Linux distribution.
