Type of challenge: *learning* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* understand the concept of conditions
* be able to write conditions


== The mission

This challenge will have you play around with the concept of {cond}[conditions],
complete the exercises down below after you've read the explanations.

With the help of *conditions* you can execute parts of code if requirements are
met. It allows you to create program with different outcome depending on the
input.

A useful predefined function would be one returning random numbers. Well here
you go, *random* does just that and all languages have an equivalent.

[title="Example",subs="quotes"]
----
// This algorithm will output "Yes, I am John Doe."
_constant_ NAME = "John Doe"
*if* ($NAME == "John Doe") *then* {
	*output*("Yes, I am $NAME.")
} *else* {
	*output*("No, I am not $NAME.")
}

// The algorithm will output a number between 0 and 100.
_integer_ nbr = *random*(100)
*output*(_$nbr_) // Prints a random numbers between 0 and 100
----

=== Exercises

.Instructions
* write your algorithm on paper
* detail each and every step
* indicates the types of used variables
* One good, try to write some code!

==== I - cinema tariffs

In a cinema the full tariff is 10 €, the reduced one is 8 €. Write an algorithm
which given a *boolean* indicating if the person can have a reduced tariff
prints the *price to pay*.

==== II - maximum

Write an algorithm which given 3 numbers finds the *maximum*.

==== III - identical dice

Write an algorithm which throws 3 dices and finds out the *number of identical
value*, three, two or none.

==== IV - day's number

Write an algorithm which given the *number of a day* returns its *name*.

==== V - print shop

A print shop charges 0.12 € the ten first copy, 0.11 € the next 20 and 0.10 €
from there. Write an algorithm which given a *number of copies* and calculates
the *price*.

== Congrats

You can now be picky about which part of your code is executed, but be careful
to choose wisely the conditions you use.
