Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *90 min* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* understand the concept of loops
* be able to write loops


== The mission

This challenge will have you play around with the concept of {loop}[loops],
complete the exercises down below after you've read the explanations.

Ever had to repeat the same instructions multiple times in a row, look no
further than the *loops*. They allow you to execute a piece of code multiple
time or until a condition is met.

A _for loop_ is usually used if you know how many iterations you need, a _while
loop_ iterates until a condition is met.

[title="Example",subs="quotes"]
----
// The output will be "0 ... 9" on a new line
*for* I = 0 *until* 9 *do* {
	output($I)
}

// Let's drink coffee
_integer_ nbr_coffee = 10
_boolean_ has_coffee = true
*while* ($has_coffee == true) *do* {
	drink_coffee()
	__$nbr_coffee__ = __$nbr_coffee__ - 1
	*if* (__$nbr_coffee__ == 0) *then* {
		__$has_coffee__ = false
	}
}

=== Exercises

.Instructions
* write your algorithm on paper
* detail each and every step
* indicates the types of used variables
* One good, try to write some code!

==== I - print numbers

Write an algorithms which receives an integers _n_ and prints:

* the numbers from 1 to _n_
* the numbers from 1 to _n_ in descending order
* the numbers from _-n_ to _n_
* the odd numbers from 1 to _n_

==== II - print random number of integers

Write an algorithm which receives an random integer and prints from 0 to it.

==== III - throw dices

Write an algorithm which throws a dice a given number of time and count the
number of time a certain number is received.

==== IV - even numbers

Write an algorithm which prints all the *even numbers* from 0 to a given number.

==== V - perfect number

Write an algorithm which verify if a given positive integer is a perfect number,
meaning equal to the sum of his divisors (except himself).

== Congrats

Loops are great to simplify your life, their will be time when you have to do
repetitive tasks and that's when you'll need them.
