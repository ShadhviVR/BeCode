Type of challenge: *consolidation* +
Duration: *2 hours* +
Turn in method: *email* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Missions objectives

At the end of this challenge you should have improved your understanding of:

* *variables*
* *conditions*
* *loops*
* *arrays*
* *functions*


== The mission

Now that you know the fundamental concepts of programming, it's time to test
your newly acquired knowledge in a trial. Complete the exercises below in a
{txt}[text file], then send it to your coach by *email*.

=== Exercises

.Instructions
* complete the exercises in a *text file*
* send the file to your coach

==== I - list of random numbers

Write a *function* which returns an array of _n_ random numbers, _n_ being the
*only* received *parameter*.

==== II - translate

The main goal of *pseudo code* is to write down the logic behind an algorithm,
so that you can easily *translate* it into _human speech_ or _code_.

.Given the algorithm below
* with your word explain its purpose
* translate it into _Python_ and _Javascript_

[subs="quotes"]
----
*function* in_array(_element_,__list_elements__) {
	_boolean_ exist = false
	*for* I = 0 *until* *length*(__$list_elements__) *do* {
		*if* _$element_ == __$list_elements__[I] *then* {
			_$exist_ = true
		}
	}
	*return* _$exist_
}
----

==== III - sort an array

Write a *function* which receives an array of ten random integers as *parameter*
and returns an ascendantly ordered array of integers.


== Congrats

The code is long and full of terrors, but you lived through your first long
night. Brace yourself though, there will be more to come.
