Type of challenge: *learning* +
Duration: *30 min* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* understand the concept of functions
* be able to write custom functions


== The mission

This challenge will have you play around with the concept of {sub}[functions],
complete the exercises down below after you've read the explanations.

A function is a *subroutine*, meaning a piece of instructions executed if called
within the main code. It can be used multiple times with different sets of value
each call. It usually needs to return a value with the *return* command.

[title="Example",subs="quotes"]
----
// This function returns the square of a number
*function* square(_nbr_) {
	*return* _$nbr_ * _$nbr_
}

*output*(square(5))// prints "25"
----

In the same vein as the loops, the functions will greatly help you improve your
code as it will enable you to reuse parts of it throughout your project.
