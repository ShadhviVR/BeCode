Type of challenge: *learning* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should:

* understand the concept of variables
* be able to declare variables
* be able to assign value to variables


== The mission

This challenge will have you play around with the concept of {var}[variables],
complete the exercises down below after you've read the explanations.

A variable is like a box holding a value, it can be called upon whenever needed
and changed after assignment (except for _constant_). It also has a type which
defines the kinds of data you can store inside.

.Types of variables
* {const}[constant]: store a value of any types that cannot change
* {int}[integer]: store integers
* {float}[float]: store real numbers (ex: 3.14159)
* {char}[character]: store one character
* {bool}[boolean]: store either _true_ or _false_
* {str}[string]: store a sequence of character
* {array}[array]: store an array of values

Programming languages usually have some predefined functions such as *output*
and *input* allowing the code to print something to the screen or ask for a user
input.

Furthermore, you should also research {oper}[operators] and how to do operation
within your code.

[title="Example",subs="quotes"]
----
// This algorithm will output "Hi my name is John Doe and I am 42."
_constant_ NAME = "John Doe"
_integer_ age

*input*("What's your age?",$age)
*output*("Hi my name is _$NAME_ and I am _$age_.")

// This algorithm will output "10".
_integer_ nbr = 5
*output*($nbr * 2)
----

=== Exercises

.Instructions
* write your algorithm on paper
* detail each and every step
* indicates the types of used variables
* One good, try to write some code!

==== I - calculate

Write an algorithm which calculates:

* the *sum* of two chosen number
* the *division* of two chosen number
* the {mod}[*modulo*] of two inputed numbers

==== II - concatenate sentence

Write an algorithm which {concat}[*concatenates*] two phrases together.

==== III - VAT

Write an algorithm which receives a *price without VAT* and returns the *price
with VAT* with a *rate of 21%*.

==== IV - surface of a circle

Write an algorithm which receives the *radius of a circle* and calculate its
*surface*.

==== V - conversion of time to seconds

Write an algorithm which receives the *time of day* in three different numbers,
the hour, the minutes and the seconds and returns the *number of seconds* since
midnight.

== Congrats

Variables, variables everywhere, they will soon become your best friend or maybe
your worst enemy, either way you're gonna need them.
