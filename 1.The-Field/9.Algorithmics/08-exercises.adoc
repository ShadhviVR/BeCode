== Missions objectives

At the end of this challenge you should have improved your:

* logical thinking
* fundamental concepts of programming


== The mission

In order to train your *logical thinking* you can try to complete the exercises
below. To succeed you should only need the fundamental concepts we have seen so
far (variables, conditions, loops, etc...), there are other structure in
programming such as _classes_, but we won't work with them in pseudo code.

NOTE: New exercises might pop up during or after the challenge, refer to your
coach for more information.

=== Exercises

.Instructions
* write your algorithm on paper
* detail each and every step
* indicate the types of used variables

==== I - leap years

Write a function which receives a year as parameter and returns _true_ if the
received value is a {leap_year}[leap year].

==== II - right and left

Write two algorithm each receiving a sentence and a number _n_, one of them will
return the _n_ first word and the second the _n_ last word.

==== III - explain and translate

Explain the algorithm below in a small paragraph with your word, then translate
it into *golang*, *pascal* and *shell script*.

----
*function* create_name_list(n) {
	_array_ list_names = []
	*for* I = 0 *until* _$n_ *do* {
		input("Enter your firstname",name)
		*add_value*(_$name_,__$list_names__)
	}
	*return* __$list_names__
}
----

==== IV - multiplication table

Write a function which receives a number and *prints* the ten first entry of its
multiplication table.

==== V - mirror number

Write a function which receives a number and return its mirror number. (example:
4209 -> 9024)

==== VI - symmetrical array

Write a function which receives an array of strings and returns _true_ if it's
symmetrical, meaning if the first element is equal to the last, etc...

==== VII - index of maximum

Write a function which receives an array of integers and return the position of
its biggest number.

NOTE: You can't use a function like `indexof`.

==== VIII - palindrome

Write a function which receives either a number or a string and check if its a
palindrome, meaning if its identical no matter the reading direction. (example:
10201, civic)

== Congrats

The most important lesson to learn from algorithmic is that *logic* is more
important than syntax as it needs to be practiced.
