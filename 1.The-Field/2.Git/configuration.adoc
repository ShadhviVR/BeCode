= Configuration

== Git

For a smoother use of git you should set it up properly. To do so you must,
define your identity (name, email) and your text editor.

* git config --global user.name "John Doe"
* git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
* git config --global core.editor "vim"

NOTE: Your identity is important to let everyone know who committed to the
repository.

=== Optional

You might want to use an *ssh key* to avoid entering your password for each
interaction with `git`. If so, follow this
https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh[guide].


== Github

While you are configuring, take the time to update your _Github_
https://github.com/settings/profile[profile].
