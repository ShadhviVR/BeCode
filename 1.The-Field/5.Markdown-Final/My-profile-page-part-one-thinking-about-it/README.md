# My profile page - part one - thinking about it

- Repository: `My-Profile-page`
- Type of Challenge: `learning challenge`
- Duration: `Bonus`

## Mission objectives

Let's prepare the future. This is the first of a series of challenges that will take place during the course. The final objective of these challenges is to for you to have an online platform/page that'll allow you to showcase your work, who you are, what you're looking for. Some kind of online resume/portfolio.

We will use this objective to learn about HTML, CSS, Javascript. But in the future also to implement some backend functionalities. Mailer, authentification, handling of databases, ...

But. First things first. Before writing any lines of code is good to have a genral Idea of what you want in your platform. To prepare a little bit if you want. To be ready.

And this is exactly what this first challenge is about. Preparing your work.

You will create a Markdown page (yet another ;)
that'll be your roadmap into developing your project. In this file/page you'll be able to find everything related to your Profile page.

##### What do you need to complete this challenge?

- A text editor of your choice to save your work.
- Git Installed on your machine
- A Github account
- An Internet Browser to travel into the sea of inspirations.



### Must-have features

- A list of all the pages you want to be present on your platform. (homepage, aboutpage, ...)

- For each page, a rough idea of the content that'll be displayed on it.

- At least one Wireframe designed using any platform (you can draw it by hand, use an app, or an online tool). [this tool is good](https://www.figma.com/templates/wireframe-kits/), but there is also [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/be_en/products/xd.html) that is free to use.

- Some links to other Websites that could be a graphic inspiration for your work.

- Answer the question. How will I make my platform stand out from all the others out there?



### Miscellanous information

Be crazy with this Challenge. I know you have no idea how you will complete certain features but that allows you a sea of opportunities. You can dream big. And we will use all your ideas as chances to learn some stuff!
