### Must-have features / Instructions



> **!! Note: The steps below are meant to help you in development, but as long as you make a cookie clicker you can implement whatever you want !! **



**Step 1:** base structure

Write the base structure for the project in **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**. Within the HTML, put a *click* button which will increment a counter and a label initialised at *0* to display said counter.

**Step 2:** prepare the JavaScript

In your JavaScript prepare variables to allow you to control your button and label. You will also need a variable to keep track of the score.

**Step 3:** increase the score

When you click the button, increase the variable storing the score by *1*, then display the current score inside the label.

**Step 4:** make a multiplier

Add another button which will act as a multiplier. When called this button will permanently multiply the number of points per click, by *two* for example.

**Step 5:** price of multiplier

The multiplier allows you to have a big score quickly, that shouldn’t be free, it should be a purchase made with the current player score.

**Step 6:** no credit

You can’t make credit, meaning that the player cannot have a negative score. Think about updating the score display after a purchase.

**Step 7:** display multiplier counter

Display the counter within the multiplier. For example, if the counter is worth *5*, then the button should display something like *multiplier x5*.

**Step 8:** increase the cost

Buying a lot of multiplier is way too easy. For more fun, make it so that each time a multiplier is purchased the cost of buying a new one is increased.

**Step 9:** display the cost

In the text of the multiplier button you should also have the price of the upgrade.

**Step 10:** auto-clicker

Implement a new improvement to buy, the *auto-click*. As the name might suggest this bonus will automatically add a click to your score each *x* seconds.

**Step 11:** bonus

Implement yet another improvement to buy, the *bonus*. It should grant the player a boost in score of *200%* per click for *30 seconds*. When purchased the player should see a timer with the remaining time inside the bonus button.

**Step 12:** deactivate the buttons

Make it so that, if the player doesn’t have the points to purchase a multiplier, an auto-click or an other bonus, he can’t.

**Step 13:** make it pretty

**Your cookie clicker must be pretty, make it look good with CSS or some extra JavaScript.**
