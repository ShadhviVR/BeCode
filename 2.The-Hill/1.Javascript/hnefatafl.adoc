Type of challenge: *consolidation* +
Repository: *hnefatafl* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Missions objectives

At the end of this challenge you should have improved your:

* *JavaScript* skills


== The mission

You have to make a website version of the {hnefatafl}[hnefatafl] board game. To
do so try to think the *structure*, the *backend* (functionality) and the
*frontend* (design) of your project before you start coding.

At the very least your version of *hnefatafl* should:

* allow movement of the pieces on the board
* implement the _basic rules_ (piece capture, winning condition, etc...)
* make it so that a piece cannot commit suicide

Optionally it can:

* use a two dimensional *array* for the board
* implement different {variants}[boards]

NOTE: The instructions below are meant to guide you not impose a way of doing
things, what matters is the end result.

.Instructions
* create the repository
* think the project through
* write the backend (make it functional)
* write the frontend (make it pretty)
* implement both parts into a web page
