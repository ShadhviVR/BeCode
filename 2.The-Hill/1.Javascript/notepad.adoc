= Notepad

Type of challenge: *consolidation* +
Repository: *notepad* +
Team challenge: *solo*


== Missions objectives

At the end of this challenge you should have improved your:

* *JavaScript* skills


== The mission

You have to make a website version of a *notepad*. To do so try to think the
*structure*, the *backend* (functionality) and the *frontend* (design) of your
project before you start coding.

At the very least your version of a *notepad* should:

* allow you to write a note
* allow for multiple notes

Optionally it can:

* implement a system of to-do linked to the notes

NOTE: The instructions below are meant to guide you not impose a way of doing
things, what matters is the end result.

.Instructions
* create the repository
* think the project through
* write the backend (make it functional)
* write the frontend (make it pretty)
* implement both parts into a web page

Taking notes, we all do it, but differently... Hopefully, with you wonderful
coding skills you can create a note taking application tailored to you need.
