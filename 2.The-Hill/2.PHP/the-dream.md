## The Mission

Dreaming about going on vacation after the course? Going somewhere far, far away?
What if we were thirsty from climbing the table mountain in South-Africa right now, or sunbathing a nice Hawaiian beach and in dire need of a cocktail?
One thing is for sure - we'd need to calculate how many Euros that way-too-expensive drink will be üí∏

### Specifications

#### üå± Must haves

- Pick your next travel destination and check the exchange rate: local currency / Euros.
- Make a small webpage where you can enter the local rate (use a form), and it'll tell you the price in Euros. A simple calculation will do, no need to get updated rates from external API's.
- Use a form that submits to PHP (no JS allowed / no preventDefault)

#### üåº Nice to haves

- Allow the user to choose between different currencies
- Provide a button to switch the from / to valuta types (So Euro -> Dollar becomes Dollar --> Euro)

    <summary>Step by step guidance (up to you if you want it)</summary>

    1. Create the HTML you need
        - What elements does the form need?
    2. Figure out what a form submit actually means / does
    3. How to get the form data after the submit?
    4. Calculate the amount in the desired valuta
    5. Figure out a way to provide this data in the HTML
