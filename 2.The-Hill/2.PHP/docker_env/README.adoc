= Docker

To setup this development environment you will need to have *docker* and
*docker-compose* installed on you system. You can add your projects to the
folder _htdocs_ and a _file.sql_ into the folder _data_.

To run the environment:

* clone the repository
* enter this folder
* run `sudo docker-compose up -d`

The environment is composed of *PHP*, *Apache* (running on port _80_), *MariaDB*
and *PHPmyadmin* (running on port _8081_).

This environment is a basic one with only an handful of tools. If you need to
implement new things, such as a mailing system, you will have to do so on the
_docker-compose.yml_ or/and _Dockerfile_.

If all is well you should have access to your environment at
http://localhost:80.

To stop the process run `sudo docker-compose down`, and to clean the created
image run `sudo docker rmi docker_env_server`.

NOTE: You can always ask help to your coach to setup your environment.
