== Hypertext Preprocessor

PHP is a *Backend* software, meaning that it runs on a _web server_, whereas
the *Frontend* designates the software acting on the side of the _client_ (the
_browser_).

PHP enables the web server to *think before it speaks*. In Computer Sciences,
_to think_ means to calculate, process information. _To speak_ means returning
to the client (the browser from where originated the http request). PHP can
create responses in most formats: very often html, but also JSON, xml, CSS,
JavaScript, etc...


== Why use PHP to return something else ?

Because this allows you to create *dynamic* pages, rather than *static* ones.
For instance, imagine you wanted to create a web page which says _Hello!_ to
each of the 7 billion inhabitants of our lovely planet. If you had to create
these pages statically, you would need to create 7 billion pages. 

[source,html]
----
<html>
	<head>...</head>
	<body><h1>Hello John Doe!</h1></body>
</html>
----

It would take years, wouldn't it? Moreover, by the time you'd be done making a
thousand page, you would already have to delete some and add some more...

That's not a good solution, But what if you could separate the _data_ from the
_display markup_ (html)? You would fetch the data from a database and simply use
one PHP file containing the markup and a variable receiving the person's name
(via the url for example). That file would generate html containing a dynamic
element.

One way to do it would be to populate the variable via the URL, like this:  

`http://<url>/index.php?name=John&lastname=Doe`

[source,php]
----
<html>
	<head>...</head>
	<body><h1>Hello <?php echo $_GET['nom']; ?> <?php echo $_GET['lastname']; ?>!</h1></body>
</html>
----

You could then just send to each person its personal URL and done! 

`http://<url>/index.php?name=Barbara&lastname=Streisand`
`http://<url>/index.php?name=Michael&lastname=Jackson`
`http://<url>/index.php?name=Bart&lastname=Simpson`
...

There! A softer, warmer lofter Earth!


== Setup

=== Local Development Server 

When we work on a project, we don't work directly on the machine that will serve
the files of the website or application, because the slightest typo mistake
would look bad and hurt the client's brand image (at the very least).

So we develop on our own PC (_development environment_), until the files are
ready for production (we then put them on the _production environment_).

=== How to setup a local development environment?

To develop in *PHP*, you need to install the _PHP suite_, to develop in *MySQL*,
you need to install _MariaDB_, but you also need a third piece of software: a
*web server*.

The most common stacks are LAMP and LEMP: Linux + Apache (or nginx, pronounced
"Engine X") + MySQL + PHP, but you can also find a Windows alternative: WAMP.
I'll let you guess what the Mac OS X version's name is...

Feel free to setup *apache*, *MySQL* and *PHP* directly on your machine.
However, It can create a bit of a mess on your system, so an alternative and a
useful technology worth learning would be to use *Docker*, a containerization
engine.

{docker}[Docker] is a tool that allows developers, sysadmins, etc. to easily
deploy their applications in a sandbox (called container) to run on the host
operating system (i.e. Linux).

The key benefit of Docker is that it allows users to package an application with
all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.
Unlike virtual machines, containers do not have the high overhead and hence
enable more efficient usage of the underlying system and resources.

We have a pre-made link:./docker_env/[environment] made with docker and
docker-compose if you choose to set yourself up this way.

You could also use http://phptester.net/[PHPTester] :)


== Exercises

Done? Then browse to `http://localhost/test/` 

You should see "Hello!". Bravo! You just created your first PHP script.
Give yourself a great loving hug, you deserve it.

* Let's play a bit with this index.php file. Add an image of cats.
* Write a second page in the same _test_ folder, call it `cats.php` and add a
  bit of content and a link to each of the two files, so that you can navigate
  from one to the other.  
* Done? Well done, you just created a website cat-egorically nice !
