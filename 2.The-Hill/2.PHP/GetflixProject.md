## Mission objectives

Now is the time to take stock of everything you've learned so far and add a layer at the same time!

And what could be better for this than putting it into practice :)

## The Mission

In this exercise you must create a Streaming site in html / css, javascript and php.

Get inspired by Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other Popcorn Time, Stremio ... The goal is to display a catalog of movies. Spot the similarities between these platforms (navbar, header, search tool, different categories of videosâ€¦) See what is cool and what works.

### Must-have features

- A session system: registration, connection / disconnection.
- Different rights: registrants have the right to comment on the content. You can add other rights depending on the different types of users.
- Include a search bar and sort by filters
- Make a secure code
- Deploy the site. PHP is not supported by github, find free alternatives.

### Nice-to-have features

- Management of lost passwords.
- Back office for user and comment management (CRUD).
- Create a page or section that displays the top movies with the movie db API.
- Integrate a newsletter with Mailchimp.

### Miscellanous information

- The videos will not be hosted by you, a simple link to the Youtube trailer will suffice.

## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the readme file:
   - What, Why, When, How, Who.
   - Pending things to do
   - It must contain a link to the "live" version. The "live" version must contain a link to the source code on GitHub.
3. Publish the link to the "live" version on Discord.

### Steps

1. Get organized. Discuss, define tasks, choose a git master, a schedule, deadlines ...
2. Use Trello, google agenda ... to help you.
3. Define your work methodology.
4. Study the request (What & Why ?)
5. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
6. Make models, diagrams of the database. Do all the research beforehand. Do not start coding before your project is studied from a to z.
7. Give briefings / debriefings, put a lot on communication, this is the key.
8. Comment out all of your code. Without comments it will be very difficult for you to work together.
9. Don't just do what you can, get out of your comfort zone.
10. Each member of the team must work on the whole project.
